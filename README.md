# My Personal Project

## Description of Application:
This application will be used to assist the users when they play the online
game *League of Legends (LoL)*. *LoL* is a multiplayer game with two teams
of 5 players where each player chooses a unique champion - the name for the
characters in the game- from the 150 in the game's cast. The goal of the game is to destroy the
enemy team's base. However, the game becomes quite complex due to the small, unique
interactions between champions. Therefore, it is quite daunting for beginners to approach this game
and even experienced players. Therefore, this application will attempt to assist these players.
This application will accomplish this goal by allowing its user to record a Champion's information, difficulty, and
interaction with other champions as this will help them when they play the game. In this application, the user will
be able to have a collection of champions that they can select to retrieve information related to them.

This application will be a helpful tool to everyone who plays *LoL*, which
is a large demographic since it is one of the most popular games in the world. In addition, *LoL*
applications that assist players have recently become quite popular; however, they frequently only offer information
and does not allow its users to edit the data. Therefore, I chose to pursue this project as I frequently play *League of Legends* during my free time,
and I always thought that a *LoL* application that allows the user to edit their own information
would be very helpful to me and some of my friends who play the game.
