# My Personal Project

## Description of Application:
This application will be used to assist the users when they play the online
game *League of Legends (LoL)*. *LoL* is a multiplayer game with two teams
of 5 players where each player chooses a unique champion - the name for the
characters in the game- from the 150 in the game's cast. However, the game becomes quite complex due to the abundant
amount of knowledge required regarding champions and their interactions with enemy champions. Therefore, it is quite 
daunting for beginners to approach this game and even experienced players struggle to memorize all the small details. 
**Therefore, this application will attempt to assist these players by allowing the user to create a collection of 
champions that they can obtain information from**. This application will accomplish this goal by allowing its user to 
record a Champion's **information, difficulty, and interaction with other champions** as this will help them when they
play the game. In this application, the user will be able to have a collection of champions that they can select to 
retrieve information related to them. In this application there are 3 classes. The Champion class is responsible for
information about a Champion, the OpposingChampion class is responsible for the champions that interact with the user's
Champion, and the ChampionCollection class is responsible for the collection of Champions.

This application will be a helpful tool to everyone who plays *LoL*, which
is a large demographic since it is one of the most popular games in the world. In addition, *LoL*
applications that assist players have recently become quite popular; however, they often only offer information
and does not allow its users to edit the data themselves. Therefore, I chose to pursue this project as I 
frequently play *League of Legends* during my free time, and I always thought that a *LoL* application that allows
the user to edit their own information would be very helpful to me and some of my friends who play the game.
